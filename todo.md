2. **README.md** - Created with all required sections
3. **.env.example** - Created with all environment variables
4. **requirements.txt** - Dependencies listed
5. **API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)** - Auto-generated by FastAPI at `/docs`
6. **LangChain/LangGraph workflow diagram** - Mermaid diagrams in README
7. **Source code comments and docstrings** - Present in all files
8. **Phase 1-4 Implementation** - All phases completed

---

## Remaining items (required)

### 1. Deployment
- Deploy the API to one of:
  - Render (recommended for FastAPI)
  - Railway
  - Fly.io
  - Hugging Face Spaces
  - Google Cloud Run
- Provide a publicly accessible API endpoint URL
- Add deployment instructions to README

### 2. Testing and verification
- Test all 3 intent types (Disease/Scheme/Hybrid) with the deployed API
- Verify responses match expected format
- Document test results or examples

---

## Optional items (bonus)

### 3. Postman collection
- Create and export a Postman collection for API testing
- Include examples for all 3 intent types

### 4. Demo video (3-5 minutes)
- Live API demonstration
- Code architecture walkthrough
- LangChain/LangGraph workflow explanation
- Intent detection and routing demonstration
- Technical decisions and trade-offs discussion
- Upload to YouTube/Loom and add link to README

### 5. LangSmith trace examples
- Screenshots or examples of LangSmith traces
- Include in README or documentation

---

## Summary

### Must do (before submission)
1. Deploy API to a cloud platform
2. Test all 3 intent types with the deployed endpoint
3. Add deployment instructions to README

### Should do (recommended)
4. Create Postman collection

### Nice to have (optional)
5. Create demo video
6. Add LangSmith trace examples

---

## Next steps

1. Choose a deployment platform (Render recommended)
2. Create deployment configuration files (e.g., `Procfile`, `render.yaml`, or Dockerfile)
3. Deploy the API
4. Test the deployed endpoint
5. Update README with deployment instructions and the live URL

Should I create the deployment configuration files, or do you want to handle deployment separately?
